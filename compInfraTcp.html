            <h4>Understanding TCP/IP and windows networking</h4>
            <p>
                When two computers communicate in a local network or internet,the communication happens at four level: the hardware,Operating system,application on each network and network.Communication begins when the computer tries to find the other computer on the local on remote network.When using web browser on a client to request a webpage from the web server,The client computer looks for the web server,the protocols for communication are established,and then the request is made and answered.<br><img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
            </p>
            <h6>Layers of network communication</h6>
            <p>When two computers or devices communicate,they must be using the same protocols so that the communication makes sense.The group or suite of protocols used is called <b>TCP/IP </b></p>
            <h6>TCP/IP model for network communication</h6>
            <p>Network communication starts when a browser(An application) requests a web page from the web server(another application).The layers of communication are shown with red arrows.The request is passed on to the OS,which passes the request to the network card,which passes the request on to the network.When the request reaches the network card on the server,the network card passes the request on to the OS and then the OS passes it on to the application(web server)</p>

            <ul>1. IP address has 32-bits aor 128-bits.<br>
                2. The Internet assigned Numbers Authority (IANA at <em>iana.org</em> ).is responsible for keeping track of assigned IP addresses <br>
                3. IP addres is organised into four groups of 8-bits each,which are presented as four decimal munbers separated by periods,Such as 192.168.8.102<br>
                4. The largest possible 8-bits is  11111111 which is equal to 255 in decimal <br>
                5. Largest IP address in decimal is 255.255.255.255 which is <ul>11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 </ul>
                6. Each of the four numbers separated by periods is called <b>octet</b>

<h6>Subnet masks</h6>
        <ul>1. All the IP addresses assigned to a local network os subnet have the matching bits in the first part of IP address,these bits are called <b>Network ID</b>. <br>
            2. The range of IP addresses assigned to a network might be 192.168.8.1-200.The first three octet <em>192.168.8</em> identify the network and the last octet <em>1 through 200</em> identify each host <br>
            3. The last bits must be unique for each IP address on the network <br>
            4. A subnet mask has 32-bits and is a string of 1s and followed by 0s. 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000 which is 255.255.0.0 in decimal.<br>
            5. IP address and subnet mask can be written in using a shorthand notation like 25.50.232.60/20. The  /20 means that the first 20 bits in the IP address identify the network.this notation is called slash notation or <b>CIDR  (Classless Interdomain Routing)</b> notation.

        <h6>Public,Private and Automatic Private IP Address</h6>
        <li>
            IEEE recommends that the following IP addresses be used for private networks:
            <ul>
                <em> 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255</em><br>
                <em>172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255</em><br>
                <em>192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255</em>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <li>
        These are special type of IP address range,if a computer connects to a network that is using dynamic IP addressing and is unable to lease an IP address from the DHCP server,it generates it's own APIPA address range of <em>169.154.x.y</em>
    </li>
    <li><b>NAT (Natwork Address Translation</b> is a technique used to conserve the numpber of public IP addresses needed by a network.A router stands between a private  network and internet,it substitudes the IP address used by computers on the private network with it's own public IP address when these computers access the internet.Advantage of NAT is security,the router hides the entire private network behind this one address.For SOHO router,expect that NAT is enabled by default</li>

            <h6>How IPv6 addresses are used</h6>
            <p>
                To improve routing capabilities and speed of communication,IPv6 changed the way IP addresses are used to find computers on the network.<br>
                    <ul> &ang; IPv6 address has 128-bits that are written as eight blocks of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, like 2001:0000:0b80:0000:0000:00d3:9c5a:00cc <br> &ang; Each block is 16 bits,the first block is written above is 2001 in hex,which can be written as 0010 0000 0000 0001 in binary <br> &ang; leading zeroes in a four-charactor hex block can be eliminated. 2001:0000:b80:0000:0000:d3:9c5a:cc, leading zeroes have been removed from three of the hex blocks <br>&ang; If blocks contain all zeroes,they can be written as double colons (::).The IP address above can be written in two ways <br> <ul>&ang; 2001::b80;0000;0000d3:9c5a:cc <br> &ang; 2001:0000:b80::d3:9c5a:cc</ul>
                    </ul>   <br>
                    To avoid confusion,only one set of double colons is used in an IPv6 address.The way computer  communicate using IPv6 has changed the terminology used to describe TCP/IP communication.Here are few terms used in the IPv6 standards
            <ul> &ang; A <b>link</b> is a local area network (LAN)  or wide area network (WAN).<br>
                &ang;  A <b>node</b> is any device that connects to the network,such as when virsual machine connects to the network or physical attachment such as when a network adapter connects to the wired network <br>
                &ang; The last 64 bits or four blocks of anIPv6 address identify the interface and are called the <b>interface ID </b>or interface identifier.These 64 bits uniquely identify an interface on the local network <br> 
                &ang; <b>Neighbor</b> are nodes on the same network.IPv6 doesn't use broadcasting,it use multicasting,anycast and unicasting <br>
                &ang; <b>Multicast address </b> is used to deliver messages to all nodes in a targeted,multicast group,such as video streaming from a server to multiple nodes on a network <br>
                &ang; <b>Anycast address </b> is used by routers and can identify multiple destinations,a message is delivered only to the closest destination<br>
                &ang; <b>Unicast address </b> is used to send message to a single node on a network.Three types of unicast addresses are link local addresses,unique local addresses and global addresses.A single interface might have more than one unicast address assigned to it at any given time: 
                <ul>
                    &ang; <b>Link local address</b> also called a link local unicast address or local address,can be used for limited communication with neighboring nodes in the same link.These local addresses are the same as APIPA in IPv4 addressing.They are addresses assigned toa computer by itself as oppsed to coming from a DHCPv6 server and are not guaranteed to be unique on the network.Most linklocal addresses begin with FE80::/64.This prefix notation means the address begins with FE80 followed by enough zeroes to make 64 bits.Link local  addresses are not allowed on the internet or allowed to travel outside private networks.<br>
                    &ang; <b>Unique local address </b> is a private address assigned by DHCPv6 server that can communicate across subnets within the private network.They are used by network administrators when subnetting a large network.A unique local address always begins with FC or FD and is usually assigned to an interface in addition to its  self-assigned link local address <br>
                    &ang; <b>Global address</b> also called a global unicast address,can be routed on the internet.These addresses are like IPv4 public IP addresses.The first 48 bits of the address is the global routing prefix.When an ISP assigns a global address to a customer,it's these 48 bits that are assigned.An organization that leases one Global Routing Prefix from it's ISP can use it to generate many IPv6 global address.

            <p>
                1. TCP/IP has assigned the Ethernet connection two IP addresses:One IPv4 address and One IPv6 address <br>
                2. The wireless LAN connection on a different subnet has also been assigned an IPv4 address and an IPv6
            </p>
            <p>
                IPv6 addressing is designed so that a computer can self-configure it's own link local IP address which is similar to how IPv4 uses APIPA, 
                    <ul>
                        1. the computer creates it's IPv6 address by using the FE80::64 prefix and uses it's MAC address to generate an interface ID for the last 64 bits <br> 2. It then performs a duplicate address detection process to make sure it's IP address is unique on the network <br>3. It then asks if DHCPv6 server is available on the network to provide configuration information.If DHCPv6 responds with IP address or default gateway's IP address,the computer uses it.It also keeps it's original link local address.DHCPv6 server serves up only global or unique local address

            <ul>TCPmakes a connection,sends the data,checks whether the data is received and resends if it is not send</ul>
            <ul>TCP is also called connection-oriented protocol</ul>
            <ul>TCPis used by applications such as emai and web browsers and it is used when it is important that the data reaches it's destination</ul>
            <ul>
                It uses protocols at the internet layer to establish  a session betweenclient and server to verify that communication has taken place.When TCP message reaches it's destination,an acknowledgement is sent back to the source.If the source doesn't receive the acknowledgement,it  resends the data or passes an error message back to the higher-level application protocol

            <li>HTTPS <b> (Http secure) </b> Refers to HTTP protocol working with a security protocol such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to create a secured socket.TLS is better than SSL. A <b>socket</b> is a connection between a browser and web server.HTTPS is used by web browsers and servers to secure the socket by encrypting the data before it is sent and then decrypting it on the receiving and before the data is processed</li>
            <li>SMTP <b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) </b> Is used to send an email message to it's destination.The email server that takes care of sending email message is often referred to as SMTP server</li>

            <li style="margin-top: 40px;" >POP and IMAP <b> (Post Office Protocon version 3 and Internet Message Access Protocol version 4) </b> After an email arrives at it's destination email server,it remains there until the recipient requested delivery.The recipient email server uses one of the two protocols to deliver the message.Using POP3,email is downloaded to the computer and the email is then deleted from the email server.Using IMAP4, the client application manages the email while it is still stored on the server</li>
            <li>RDP <b> (Remote Desktop Protocol) </b> Is used by the windows remote desktop and remote assistance utilities to connect to  and control a remote computer </li>
            <li>Telnet is used by telnet client/server applications to allow administrator or other user to control a computer remotely.It is not secure because transmissions in telnet are not encrpted</li>
            <li>SSH <b> (Secured Shell ) </b> Protocol encrypts communications so hackers can't read the data if they intercept a transmission.SSH is used in various situations for encryption such as remotely controlling a computer or when communicating to a server.SSH is commonly used in Linux to pass signing information to a remote computer and control that computer over a network,it is secure and preferred over Telnet </li>
            <li>FTP <b> (File Transfer Protocol) </b> Is used to transfer files between two computers over WAN or LAN connection.Web browsers can use the protocol as can File Explorer in woindow,also third party FTP client software such as CuteFTP <em>cutetp.com</em> or open source FileZilla <em>( filezilla-project.org</em> offer edditional features.FTP transmission is not secure.Two protocols that encrypt FTP transmisions are FTPS (FTP Secure ),which uses SSL encryption and SFTP (SSH FTP),which uses SSH encryption</li>
            <li>SMB <b> (SErver Massage Block) </b> Is a file access protocol originally developed bby IBM and used by windows to share files and printers on a network.The current release of the SMB protocol is SMB 3.the older version include SMB 2 and a spinoff protocol  called <b>CIFS (COmmon Internet File System</b></li>
            <li>AFP <b> (Apple Filing Protocol) </b> is a file access protocol used by earlier edition s of the Mac operating system by Apple and is one protocol in the old suite of Apple networkikng protocols called AppleTalk.TCP/IP  has replpcaed AppleTalk for most networking protocols in the macOS.Current macOS releases use SMB 3 for file access and supoort both AFP and CIFS for backward compatibility.</li>
            <li>LDAP <b> (LIghtweight Directory Access Protocol) </b> Is used by various clients applications when thee application needs to query a database.Data is sent and received using LDAP protocol is not encrypted.Encryption layer using SSL  is sometimes added to LDAP transmissions  </li>
            <li>SNMP <b> (Simple Network Management Protocol) </b> Is a versitile protocol used to monitor network traffic and manage devices.It can help create logs for monitoring devices and network performance.It can make automatic  changes to devices being monitored,and it can be used to alert network technicians when bottleneck or other performance issues are causing problems in the networkThe SNMP server is called the manager,and a small application called an agent is installed on devices being managed by SNMP </li>
