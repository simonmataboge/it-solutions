                <h6>Functions of a router</h6> 
                <p>
                    Routers can range from small designed to a managed SOHO network that connects to an ISP to those who manage multiple networks and extensive traffic.On SOHO,a router stands between ISP network and the local network and the router is the gatewsy to the internet
                </p>
                <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                <p>SOHO router functions</p>
                <li>SOHO router stands in between two networks,namely ISP network and local network</li>
                <li>As a <b>switch</b> it manages several network ports that can be connected to a wired computers on a local network or to a dedicated switch that provides even more ports for locally network computers</li>
                <li>As a DHCP server,it can provide IP addresses to computers and other devices on the local network</li>
                <li>As a <b>wireless access point</b>, it enables wireless devices to connect to the internet.</li>
                <li>As a <b>firewall</b>, It blocks unwanted traffic from the internet and can restrict internet access for local devices behind the firewall.Restrictions on the local devices can apply to days,weeks,time of the day,keywords used,certain websites and specific applications,it can also limit network and internet access to specific computers,based on their MAC addresses</li>
                <li>Used as an <b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol ) server,</b> You can connect to an external hard drive to the router and FTP firmware on the roouter can be used to share files with networks users</li>

                <p>
                    Physical security is number one thing co consider when placing a router,If it will be used as a wireless access point,make sure it is centrally located to create the best Wi-Fi hotspot for users.Don't place the router in a public space in a small business if you want best security,place the router in a locked room.the indoor range for a Wi-Fi hotspot is up to 70 meters,this range is affected by many factors,including interference from walls,furniture,electrical equipment and other nearby by hotspots.For best Wi-Fi strength,position your router or wireless access point in the center of where you want want your hostpot and higher position works better than lower,like near ceiling
                </p>
                <p>
                    For routers that have external antennas,raise the antennas to vertical positions,plug in the router and connect network cables to devices on the local network.Connect the network cable from ISP modem or other device to uplink port on the router.To configure a router for the first time or change it's cofiguration,always follow the instructions of the manufacturer. You can use any computer on the network that uses a wired connection to configure the firmware on the router.You will need IP address of the router and default username and password to access the router setup,you can find username and password on the documentation or search on the web for your model and brand
                </p>
                <li>
                    Open your browser and enter the IP address of the router in the address box.Enter default username  and password<br>

                </p>
                <h6>Configure the dhcp server</h6>
                <p
                   >Click <b>ADVANCED</b> tab,and then click <b>LAN Setup</b>,you can disable or enable the DHCP server and set the IP address of the router and subnet mask for the network,set the starting and ending  IP addresses,which determines the range of the IP addresses  DHCP can serve up,always save the changes 
                <img alt=""  src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                </p>
                <h6>Reserve IP addresses</h6>
                <p>
                    In a network,there are certain devices which need a consistent IP address so that computers can access the printer,don't need to change the IP address each time they connect to the network,computer that is running web server also need IP address thst is consistent.Printer and web server need to be assigned static IP addresses .You will need to craete an address reservation on the DHCP server so that the DHCP receive the same IP address from the server evrytime it connects to the  network.<br>Do the following to reserve an IP address
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To identify computer of printer,you will need it's MAC address. Click the <b>ADVANCED</b> tab and click <b>Attached Devices </b> in the administration group,copy the MAC address
                   
                    </li> <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                    <li>
                        Go to the LAN Setup page,click <b>Add </b> under <b>Address Reservation</b>.Enter the IP address to assign to the computer or printer.Be sure to use an IP address in the range of IP address assinged by the DHCP  server. Select the MAC address from the list of attached devices or copy or type the MAC address in the field.Click <b>Apply </b> to save the caches It's helpful to network users to write  IP address on a label taped in a plain sight on the printer or web server
                    
                    </li><img alt=""  src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                </ul>
                <h6>MAC address fitering</h6>
                <p>
                    <b>MAC address filtering</b>.Allows you to restrict access to your network  to certain computers or devices.If a MAC address is not entered in the table of MAC addresses. The device is not allowed to connect to the network.MAC address table can be viewed and edited on the ADVANCED tab of the Access Control page in the Securioty group.To turn on Access Control,click the <b>Turn on Access Control</b> check box and then allow or block each MAC address in the table
                <img alt=""  src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                </p>
                <h6>QoS for an application or device</h6>
                <p>You can improve network performance using Quality os Service  feature if you realise that a device or computer is not getting the best service.Some applications might need high priority ,like video  conferencing (skype).<br>Do the following
                    <ul>
                        1. Sign in to the router's firmware and go to <b>Media Prioritization</b> page. Turn on <b>Prioritization</b>, then you can drag a device into the list of High priority.You can also select applications or websites and drag them to the list. <br>
                        2. After all applications or websites are listed in the table,click <b>OK</b> to save changes

                </p>
                <h6>Universal plug and Play</h6>
            <p>
                <b>(UPnP) Universal Plug and Play</b> helps computers on the network automatically discover and communicate with services provide by other computers on the local network.Enable UPnP if computers on the network use applications,such as messaging,gaming or windows remote assistance,which run on other local computers and there is a problem establishing communication.A computer can use router to advetise it's services to other computers ont he network. UPnP is considered a security risk because it shields between computers are dropped wich hackers might exploit.UPnP is enabled on the UPnP page in the Advanced Setup group on the ADVANCED tab. Any computer and their ports that are currently using UPnP are listed
            </p>
            <h6>Update router firmware</h6>
            <p>To maintain a router,you need to check msnufacturer's website to check for updates to the router's firmware,download the firmware and apply the updates. Click <b> A router firmware upgrade is available</b>

                <h6>Limiting internet traffic on your network</h6> 
                <p>Router's firewall can examine each message coming from the internet and decide if the message is allowed to the local network.A message is directed to a particular computer using IP address and paricular application running on that computer.The application is identified by a pport number also called <b>port address</b> <br>
                    Most application on the internet or a local network are <b>Client/server application</b>.Internet explorer,Google Chrome or outlook,communicate with the server applications such as web server or email server.each client and server application installed on a computer listens at predetermined port that is uniquely identified the application on the computer.Routers offer the option to diasble all ports,which means that no activity from the internet can get in, For some router's you must specify exceptions to this firewall rule in order to allow unsolicited traffic from the internet.Exceptions are allowed using port forwading or DMZ,you can also limit internet traffic by filtering content.</p>

                <h6>Setting up a wireless network</h6> 
                <p>a wireless network is created by wireless access point.the staandards for local wireless network are caaled <b>Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) </b> and their technical name is IEEE 802,11 known as the <b>802,11 a/b/g/n/ac </b> standards <br>the list details the progression of ranges and frequencies for each standard:
                
                </p>
                <ul>
                    &ang; <b><em>802,11a</em></b> Short range up to 50 meters with radio frequency of 5.0 GHz<br>
                    &ang; <b><em>802,11b</em></b> Longer range of 100 meters (indoor ranges are less than outdoor ranges) and radio frequency of 2.4 GHz<br>
                    &ang; <b><em>802,11g</em></b>Same range as 802,11b but with faster speed of 54 Mbps<br>
                    &ang; <b><em>802,11n</em></b>Can use frequency of 5,0 GHz or 2.4 GHz radio frequency with indoor range up to 70 meters and outdoor range uo tp 250 meters<br>
                    &ang; <b><em>802,11ac</em></b> Uses the 5.0 HGz radio frequency and has the same ranges as 802,11n<br>

                <h6 style="margin-top: 140px;">Security Key</h6>
                <p>
                    By default,a network that uses a security key encrypts data travesing the network,therefore the most effective and most common method of securing a wireless network is to require a security key before a client can access the network.Use the router firmware to set the security key,for best security,enter a security key  that is different from the password for the router's configuration utility.To access security key.go to ADVANCED tab,security key is called Password or Network key,click apply to save changes
                     <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
    
              <h6>Set encryption</h6>
              <p>
                  Routers by default encrypt wireless transmissions.You can change encryption protocol used or disable encryption.Encrypting transmissions secures the network but it slows it down,disabling encryption can improve performance and might be appropriate when you are not concerned about transmission being hacked.Three main security standards for 802,11 wireless networks are:
                  <ul>
                        &ang; <b>WEP</b> . (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is no longer considered secure because the key used for  encrption is static (doesn't change)<br>
                      &ang; <b>WPA</b>. (Wi-Fi Protected Access) Stronger than WEP and was designed to replace it.WPA uses <b>TKIP ( Temporaly key integrity protocol ) </b>for encryption.TKIP generates a different key for every transmission,however the encryption algorithm used for it's calculations is no longer considered secure<br>
                      &ang; <b>WPA2 (Wi-Fi protected Access 2 )</b> also called 802,11i standard is the current wireless standard.WPA2 uses AES( advanced encryption standard ) for encrpption which provides faster and more secure encrption than TKIP. All wireless devices sold today support the WPA2 standard<br>
                      &ang; <b>WPA3 (Wi-Fi protected access 3 )</b>Offers better encryption and additional features( You can securely configure a wireless device without the need to connect to a wired network and has another feature called Individual Data Encryption, which allows a secure connection for your wireless device over public network). <br>To configure WPA3,first find out if the router support WPA3,you can check documentation or manufacturer's website 
                </ul>
              </p>
                <h6>Change the default SSID abd disable SSID broadcasting</h6>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Service Set Identifier (SSID)</b> Is the name of a wireless network,each frequency band has its own SSID and you can change its name.Each band is its own network  which router connects to the local wired network. You can select the bans that is best for your device,if your laptop supports 802,11 ac,you can select SSID 5-GHz which supports 802,11ac for faster speed of the 802,11ac standards,if you select the SSID for 2.4GHz band,the connection  would revert to the slower 802,11n standard.There is also an option to enable or disable SSID broadcast.When you disable broadcast,the network will appear as Unnamed or Unknown network on an end user's device.When a client selects this network,she is given the opprotunity to enter th SSID.This security is not considered to be strong because the software can be used to discover an SSID that is not being broadcast
                    </p>
                <h6>Select channels for the WLAN</h6>
                    <p>
                        A <b>channel</b> is  a specific radio frequency within a broader frequency.Two channels in the 2.4 GHz band are 2.412 GHz and 2.437 GHz,in United States eleven channels are available for wireless communication in th 2.4 GHz band.To avoid overlap,devices in the 2.4 GHz band select 1,6, or 11 resulting in three nonoverlapping channels available for use.The 5 GHz band offers up to 24 nonoverlapping channels in the United States,some channels are restricted in certain areas such as near airport.For most networks you  can aloow auto channel selection so that the device scans for the least busy channel,you can manually set each network to a different channel and make the channels far apart to reduce interference.<img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                    </p>
                <h6>Radio power levels and WAP placement</h6>
                    <p>
                        Placing the access point in the center not only maximize it's range in the target area but also minimizes the signal's reach  outside of the target area,which increases security.A wireless signal that reaches to public areas invites unauthorized users to park nearby and take their time attempting to crack your wireless security measures High-end access points allows you to adjust the radio power levels  the wireless network can use.To reduce interference,save electricity or limit the range of the network to your own property,reduce the power level
                    </p>
                <h6>Wireless QoS</h6>
                    <p>
                        You can improve QoS of a device by assigning it to high priority list,for wireless devices,you can further improve QoS by enabling WMM (W-Fi Meltimedia ). When WMM is enabled,the wireless access point will prioritise wireless traffic for audio,video  and voice over other types of wireless network traffic
                    </p>
                <h6>Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS)</h6>
                    <p>
                        WPS which was designed to make it easier for users to connect their computers to a wireless network when a hard-to -remember SSID and security key are used.WPS generates the SSID and security key using a random string of hard-to-guess letters and numbers. The SSID is not broadcast,so both the SSID and security key must be entered correctly to connect.a user presses a button on a wireless computer or on the router,or enters an eight digit PIN assigned to the router.All computers on the network must support WPS for it to be used and you must enable WPS on the router<br>
                        <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WPS might be a security risk if it's not well managed.To improve WPS security,turn on auto disable so that WPS will be disabled after a few failed PIN entered.If the router doesn't have the auto disable feature,don't use WPS.An eight digit PIN is easy to hack with repeated attempts, if the router has WPS button to push,don't use WPS unless the router is in secured physical location.For improved secirity,turn on WPS only when you are working with a user to connect to the wireless network then turn it off
