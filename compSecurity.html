            <h4>Protecting network resources</h4>
            <h6>Physical security and access control</h6>
            <p> Physically protecting access to a computer's resources if often seen by security experts as the most important and most overlooked form of security.Here are some best practices for physical security: <br>
                &ang; <em>If data is really private,keep it behind door or under lock and key</em> .Keep your computer behind a locked door.You can also store the data on a removable storage device such as external hard drive and when you are not using data, put the drive in a fireproof safe(keep two copies that are stored in a different locations).Printout documents should be kept under lock and key,as well as any passwords you might have written down.Door locks includes keyed locks,combination locks and biometric locks.<b>Biometric locks</b>  require special input called <b>biometric data</b> to identify a person by her fingerprint,handprint,face,retina,iris,voice or handwritten signature<br><img alt=""  src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /><br>
                &ang; <em>Use server locks or cable locks. </em> Some computers allow you to add a lock so that you can physically prevent others from opening the case.These locks  called <b>server locks </b> might be used on computers that hold corporate data.You can also use a <b>cable lock </b> or <b>Kensington lock</b> to secure a laptop or other computer to a table so someone can't walk away with it.Most laptops have a security slot on the case to connect the cable lock,Those slot is called <b>Kensington security Slot or K-slot</b>. Theft occur in private offices or hotel rooms,so even if you are not sitting in a public area with your laptop,consider keeping it locked to a nearby table or post.Be sure to choose a cable lock that resists tampering with pliers or cable cutters<br>
                <img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                <img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /><br>
                &ang; <em>Secure ports with port locks</em> Any exposed port on a device such as RJ-45 port or a USB port can be used to access the device and compromise security.USB ports are considered as security risks due to the fact that someone could walk in and install or upload malware or download sensitive data in a small flash drive carried in a pocket. You might also install <b>port lock</b> to restrict physical access to the exposed ports.The <b>USB lock</b> consists of three pieces.The two pieces are inserted into the USB port,sealed into place with the wire loop,lock a cable into the port so it can't be easily removed<br><img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                &ang; <em>Use private screens</em> To keep other people from viewing a monitor screen,you can install a <b>privacy screen</b> also called <b>Privacy filter</b>, that fits over the screen to prevent it from being read from a wide angle.This is especially useful in tight quarters,such as on an airplane,bus,or subway or other exposed locations such as receptionist's desk<br>
                &ang; <em>Install a theft-prevention plate</em> Physically mark a computer case or laptop so ti can be identified if it is later stolen.You embaded aa theft-prevention plate into the case and engrave or tatoo your ID  information into it.The barcode identify you as the owner and can clearly establish to police that a laptop has been stolen. To further identify stolen equepment,record sereal numbers and model numbers in a safe place separate from the equipment.This information can be used in an inventory management system<br>
                <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /><br>
                &ang; <em>Use a mantrap and security guard</em> Physical security is a mantrap,which consists of two doors on either end of a n entry way where the first door must close before the second door can open and can only accomodate one person at the time,to avoid piggy bagging.A separate form of identification might be required for each door,such as a badge for the first door and a fingerprint on the second door.A security guard might also maintain an <b>entry control roster</b>, which is a list of people allowed into the restricted ares and a log of any approved visitors<br>

            <h6>Logical security and access control</h6>
            <p> Windows firewall, can make up a significant portion of your defense resources.Other types of software-based security measures include:
                &ang; <em>Antivirus/anti-malware</em> Antivirus or anti-malware monitors a device for activity that is recognised to be harmful to data or other resources.The software then attempts to block the activity,identify the source of problem and remove any malicious files that have infected the computer<br>
                &ang; <em>Email filtering</em> Filters out suspicious messages based on database of known scams,spammers and malware.Corporations  might route incoming and outgoing emails through a proxy server for filtering with the following goals in mind
            <ul>
                1. Incoming email is inspected for scams or spam that might trick an  employee into introducing malware into the corporate network <br>
                2. Outgoing emails from employees might be filtered for inappropriate content.This lawful interception is intented to verify that an employee is complying with privacy laws and is not accidentally or intentionally leaking corporate data and secrets.This is example of <b>data loss prevention (DLP) </b> software which helps to protect against leaking corporate data 
            </ul><br>
                &ang; <em>Trusted software sources.</em> Download software from a trusted publishers and providers,also know that the website might be trying to trick you into thinking you are downloading applications,software updates or drivers from the source when you are actually downloading malware.Be careful which sites you use for software downloads <br>
                &ang; <em>Access Control Lists</em> An ACL includes which user,device or program has the access to a particular resource,such as printer,floder on a corporate network computer.Large corporate network manages ACL through Active Directory on a windows domain, and small  peer-to-peer  networks,each computer controls access to it's own resources.For both networks,<b>Group policy </b> can control user rights anf NTFS permissions and share permissions control access to files and folders<br>
                &ang; <em>Port security and MAC address filtering</em> A switch has a multiple Ethernet ports for devices to connect to the network.Any device can connect to any port,however you can enable <b>port security</b>  to control which devices can use any port or a specific port on the switch.<br>Most managed switches  can provide <b>MAC address filtering</b> which allows you to specify how many MAC addresses a port can accept or to provide a whitelist of MAC addresses the switch will accept.Because it is easy to spoof or counterfeit a legitimate MAC address,MAC address filtering is not considered a recommentded best practice as your only layer of defense against attact<br>

                &ang; <em>Virtual private network</em> protects data by encrypting it over a remote connection to a private network.VPN software creates a virtual tunnel between the client computer and VPN server behind the private networks firewall.Network packets are encrypted at one end of the tunnel and decrypt it at the other end  as they exit the tunnel.VPN connections are used in telecommuters to securely connect to their corporate networks or for individuals to securely surf the web.Managed switches  sometimes have VPN services embedded in their firmware so they can provide VPN connections for remote users of the private network to which they belong<br>

                &ang; <em>Mobile device management</em> Corporate and personal mobile devices present a particular set of security challenges because they hold sensitive company data while traveling outside of the company network's physical perimeter.<b>Mobile device management (MDM)</b> software provides tools for tracking mobile devices,even if they are turned off, and managing the data on those devices.MDM policies typically include:
            <ul>
                1 . Security policy enforment,such as applying patches or enforcing password requirements <br>
                2. Data encrytion requirements ,to protect data on the mobile device even if it falls into the wrong hands <br>
                3. Remote wipe capabilities,to erase all data on the device
            </ul>MDM installs a small app called an <b> agent</b> on a managed device which communicates through various Wi-Fi or cellular connection back to the MDM server in the company data center.The initial installation of the agent and the agent checking the device for security compliace is called <b>on-boarding</b>.The reverse process when the mobile devices is removed from the MDM fleet is called <b>off-boarding</b><br>

            <h6>User authentication</h6>
            <p>Besides windows authenticating a user with a windows password,you can increase authontication security using the following methods: <br>
                &ang; Enforce a <b>password policy</b>, which is a set of rules that a defines the minimum length of a password,complexity requirements and  how frequently a password must be reset.<br>
                &ang; Enforce <b>multifactor authentication</b>, which requires at least one more factor or action to authenticate beyond the single-factor  password.<b>Two-factor authentication (2FA) </b> is the most often used and the two factors normally involve what the user:
                <ul>
                    1. Know (password) <br>
                    2 Possesses,which is called token ( such as smartcard or key fob ) <br>
                    3. Does (such as typing a certain way ) <br>
                    4. Is which is called biometric data ( such as fingerprint )
                </ul>
            Factors such as smart card  or biometric data should be used in addition to,not as a replacement for,windows password 
            </p>
        <h6>Hardware security token</h6>
        <p>
            Two types of hardware security tokens are smart card and a key fob: <br>
        &ang; A <b>smart card </b> is used as a security token has an embedded microprocessor,which is ussually installed on the card under a small gold plate.Most current credit cards have a gold plate and a microprocessor and are smart cards,as opposed to earlier credit cars that used only magnetic strip with no internal processor.The microprocessor contains information that is read by a <b>smart card reader or badge reader</b> when the device is inserted into the reader or transmitted wirelessly.Most smart card's can receive information from the card reader to confirm that the reader is authentic.This is called <b>mutual authentication</b>, which occurs when authentication goes in both directions at the same time and both entities confirm the identity of the other.Smart card contains a microprocessor and data,it's considered both hardware token  and software token
            <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> <br>
        &ang; A <b>key fob</b> is a hardware token that fits conveniently on a keychain,the number on the key can change every 60 seconds.When a user signs in to the network, she must enter the number on the  fob,which is synchronized with the network authentication service.Entering the number proves that the user has the key fob in hand,because the device doesn't actually make physical contact with the system,it is called a contactless token or disconnected token
        </p>
        <h6>Software surity tokens</h6>
        <p>Can be security tokens stored as an app or digital certificate.Here is how each works: </p>
        <p>&ang; <b>Software token apps</b> Sometimes called authenticator apps,are installed on your smartphone or other computing device and can perform the same service as a key fob,providing a couter or number generator that serves as one factor in multifactor authentication.This app is synchronized with the same calculations on the server so that the app and the server expect the same number at the same time.Software token provides a 2FA include Google Authenticator.<em>( google.com</em> Twilio Authy <em> ( authy.com )</em>.In general to set up 2FA with an online account, you would: <br>
            1. Sign up for and configure the 2FA service with a 2FA provider such as Twilio.You will download and install it's authenticator app to your phone or computer <br>
            2. Enable 2FA with a facebook,Google,Banking or other account you want to secure <br>
            3. Configure the account to use the 2FA service <br>
            4. Each time you sign in to the account,you must provide your password and the number generated by the authenticator app.<br>
        &ang; <b>Digital certificate</b> it is a digital signature that proves a person or entity,such as web server ,is who they say they are.It's a small file that holds information about the identity of a person or entity.A public encrytion is used to prove the certificate is legit and similar to a notary verifying that a signature is legitimate.the digital certificate and public encryption key are assigned by <b>Certificate Authority</b> that has confirmed your identity in a separate process.VeriSign <em>( verisign.com )</em> and aglobalSign (globalsign.com) are two well known CA's.You purchase digital certificate fromn CA and then install it on your desktop or in smart card or flash drive that you use with your computer.
        </p>
        <h6>Authentication services</h6>
        <p>Active Directory is used to authenticate users on windows to the domain and authorize users what they can do  with domain resources.Everything that the user is trying to do once they are authenticated,it can be logged for future auditing.These three security measures are known as <b>AAA ( Authenticating, authorizing and accounting</b>
            <ul>
                &ang; <b>RADIUS ( Remote access dial-in user service )</b> was developed to authenticate end users accessing resources on a network through dial-up connections and has evolved to other types of connections to a network,including wired,wireless and VPN <br>
                &ang; <b>TACACS+ ( Terminal access control access control system plus )</b> Was developed by Cisco to improve RADIUS for AAA services to connect to a network remotely to configure and manage routers,switches and firewalls<br>
                <p>RADIUS and TACACS+ can both work on active directory to authenticate and authorize users  to the network,both can support wireless or wired  and VPN connections,both use client,server and user directory</p>
                &ang; <em>Client</em> Client is responsible for quirying RADIUS or TACACS+  server to authenticate the user before allowing the user to the network <br>
                &ang; <em>Server</em> Server authenticate the user by quirying the user directory.Cisco calls it's TACACS+ server the Identify Service Engine server (ISE server)  <br>
                &ang; <em>User directory</em> ISE server quiries a user directory  or database ( where credentials are stored).Active directory is ther most popular user directory for large networks<br>

            <h6>User education</h6>
            <p>People are the weakest link when coming to setting up a network  because they are so easily convinced into giving away private information.Many users open an email attachment,or enter credit card information on a website without regard to security,download funny screensavers even with lot of information being spread around about cyber security.<br>
            <b>Social engineering </b> is a practice of tracking people into giving out private information or allowing unsafe program into the network or computer.A good techinian is aware of the criminal practices used  and is able to teach users how to recognise and avoid this mischief.<b>Acceptable user policy (ACP)</b> is a document that can help educate the users,it explains what the user can and cannot do on the corporate network or with company data and explains penalties for violations.AUP also descripes measures users can take to protect the network security and measures that they need to follow to protect password and the computer system:
                <ul>
                    &ang; Never give out your password to anyone,not even your supervisor or tech person who calls for it or even send an email requesting for it<br>
                    &ang; Don't store your password on a computer unless you use company-approved password fault software.<br>
                    &ang; Don't use the same password on more than o0ne computer,network,application or website<br>
                    &ang; Be aware of  <b> (shoulder surfing) </b> which is when people are secretly peeking at your monitors you work.A privacy filter can help <br>
                    &ang;Lock down your workstation each time you step away from your desk <br>
                    &ang; users need to be on alert for <b> (tailgating) </b> which is when unauthorized person follow you through secured entrance to a room or building. Another one is when a user walks away from a computer that is not locked and another person continues to use the windows session<br>

            <ul>
                &ang; When traveling,always know where your laptop is.Tuck your laptop case between your ankles,never leave your laptop ias baggage and don't store it in airplane overheat bins:keep it at your feet<br>
                &ang; Never leave a laptop in an unlocked car.Use a laptop cable lock to secure it to a table <br>
                &ang; When at work,lock your laptop in a secure place or use a laptop cable lock to secure it
