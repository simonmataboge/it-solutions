            <h4>Dealing with malicious software on personal computer</h4>
            <h6>What are we up against</h6>
            <p>
                <b>Malicious software</b> is any unwanted program that is intended for harm and is transmitted to your computer without your knowledge.<b>Grayware </b> is any anoying and unwanted program that might harm or not harm such as adware that produces all those unwanted pop-ups ads
            </p>
            <li><b>Virus</b> <br> Is a program that replicates by attaching itself to other programs.The infected program must be executed for a virus to run.This program might be an application,a macro in a document</li>
            <li><b>Spyware</b><br> Spies on you to collect personal information that it transmit over the internet to web-hosting sites.<b>keylogger </b> Is a spyware that tracks all your keystrokes and can be used to steal your identity,credit card number,security number,bank information,passwords and so forth</li>
            <li><b>Worms</b> <br> Is a program that copies itself throughout the network or the internet without a host program.it creates problems by overloading the network as it replicates and can even hijack or install a server program such as web server</li>
            <li><b>Trojan</b> <br>Does not need a host to function,it substitutes itself for a legitimate program,it is often embbeded  in the files of legitimate software that is downloaded from an untrusted website or a user is tricked into opening an email attachment</li>
            <li><b>Rootkits</b> <br> Load itself before OS boot is complete.It can hide in boot managers,boot loader programs or kernel mode device drivers.UEFI secure boot is especially designed to catch rootkits that launch during boot.Because rootkit is already loaded when  most anti-malware software loads,it is sometimes overlooked by the software.A rootkit can hide folders that contain it has installed,cause Task manager to display a different name for it's process,hide registry keys and can operate in user mode or kernel mode.This trick helps it remaim undetected.A rootkit running in a kernel mode interferes with the windows kernel and susbtitutes it's own information in a place of the raw data read by windows kernel.Because most anti-malware software to one degree or another,relies on windows tools and components to work,the rootkit is not detected or cannot be deleted if the windows tools themselves are affected</li>
            <li><b>Ransomware</b> <br>Holds your computer hostage until you pay money.Some are embedded in email attachments and work on windows,android and some IOS systems.When the user clicked the attachment,the program encrypted the computer's files.If the user didn't pay within a 24-hour period,all the files will be lost.Many users who did not have backups of their data chose to pay ransome.A computer  infected with ransomware can infect all computers on the network and even cloud servers to which the computer connects to </li>
            <li><b>Zero-day attack</b> <br>Can happen in two ways:a hacker discovers a security hole in a software that is unknown to the developer of the software or a hacker takes advantage of a recently reported gap in software security before the user apply patches released by the developer.The race is on for the developer to provide a patch and the user to apply those patches before hackers have even one day to use the hole to infect systems and steal user data.Microsoft publisher security patches on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month but sometimes releases patches off schedule so that hackers have less time to attack customers</li>
            <li><b>Man-in-the-middle attack</b> <br>The attacker intercepts communication between two parties and reads/alters the content of messages.The attacker can impersonate a legitimate website,network,FTP site or person in a chat session.User might connect to an "evil twin" Wi-Fi hotspot,thinking it's a legitimate hotspot and attempt to start a chat session with a business associate.The attacker pretands to be the business associate and continues the chat with the intention of obtaining private information.The best protection against man-in-the-middle attcks is to use digital certificates to identify a person or service before transmitting sensitive information</li>
            <li><b>Denial of service (DoS)</b> <br>Attack overwhelms a computer or network with requests or traffic until new connections can no longer be accepted.A <b>distributed denial of service (DDoS)</b> attack happens when multiple computers are involved in the attack.DDoS attacks are sometimes performed by botnets</li>
            <li><b>Zombies and botnets</b> <br>Zombi is a compuetr that has been hacked and the hacker is using the computer to run repetitive software in the background without the knowledge of it's user.The zombie might be email spamming or performing DDoS attacks.A hacker might build an entire network zombies which is called <b>botnet</b> ( a network of robots) </li>
            <li><b>Dictionary attack</b> <br>Can be used to crack a password by trying words in a dictionary.Password cracker software might combine a <b>brute-force</b> attack( systematically trying every possible combination of words,letters numbers and symbols) with a dictionary  attact to guess the password</li>
            <li><b>Rainbow tables</b> <br>Contains a long list of plaintext passwords,just as users would enter and and the password hash list after it is encrypted. When a hacker obtains a stolen list of hashed passwords,she can compare this list with those in her rainbow tables to find a match.When two hashed match,she can use plaintext password in the rainbow table to sign in to the system,impersonating the user.Rainbow tables make cracking passwords faster than dictionary cracking or bruteforce cracking.The best defenses against rainbow table attacks are for an organization to use the very best hashing techniques to encrypt their passwords and to add extra characters to the password hash ( called salting the passwords )</li>
            <li><b>Noncompliant systems and violation of security best practices</b> <br>System administrator needs techniques in place to routinely scan BYOD and corporate-owned smartphones,tablets,laptops,desktops,servers, for noncompliant systems that violate security best practices such as out-of-date anti-malware software or where it is not installed.One product that is designed to scan devices for noncomplaint is <b>System Center Configuration Manager by Microsoft</b>, which works with microsoft Intune.Intune focuses on mobile devices that connect to a corporate network</li>

            <h6>Step-by-step attack plan</h6>
            <p>
                Step by step attack plan to clean up infected system.We use anti-malware software called antivirus to remove all types of nnti-malware,including virus,spyware,worms and rootkits.Then we use windows tools to make sure that all remnants of malware have been removed and the system is in order
            </p>
            <h6><b>STEP 1</b> Identifying and researching malware symptoms</h6>
            <p>
                IT technician need to know how to recognize a system that is infected.Here are some warnings about malicious software at work:
            </p>
            <li>
                <b>Pop-up ads and browser redirection</b> User looses thwe control of the system,pop up ads rendomly appear and browser home page has changed.A browser might also have an uninvited toolbar.Security alerts-real or spoofed-regularly interrupt the user's activity

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rogue antivirus software</b> When the user try to use windows defender,it fails to run.When you open the Action center to find that defender has been disabled because other antivirus software you did not install is running.Windows allow only one antivirus to run at the time.Use Task Manager to stop the rogue antivirus software and then start windows defender <br>
                <img alt="" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> 
            </li>
            <li><b>Slow performance or lockups</b> The system works much slower than before,Programs take longer to than normal to load Error messages appear,programs that worked before,now they give you error messages.Task Manager shows unfamiliar processes running.The computer OS might lock up</li>
            <li><b>Internet connectivity issues,application crashes and OS update failures</b> These problems seem to plugue the system with no reasonable  explanation that is specific to the network,application or windows update</li>
            <li><b>System and application log errors</b> The administrative events logs in event viewer report system and application erros,system crashes,application crashes and failed OS updates</li>
            <li><b>Problem with files</b> File names  seem to have changed and size of the files are extremely large.Executables files have changed size or file extentions change without reason.Files disappear or appear.Windows system files are renamed.Files become corrupted,files you could once access now give you access-denied messages and file permissions change</li>
            <li><b>Email problems</b> You receive a message from other users saying you have sent them spam or infected messages or you received automated replies indicating you didn't know about.This type of attack indicates your email address or email client software on your computer has been hijacked.Extra spam you are not accustomed to seeing shows up </li>
            <li><b>Problems updating your anti-malware software</b> You can access other websites but you can't access ant-malware software sites such as <em>symantec.com </em> or <em>mcafee.com</em> and you cannot update your anti-malware software</li>
            <li><b>Invalid digital certificates</b>  An OS is responsible for validating certificates used to secure communication.Microsoft maintains a database of trusted root certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs). A <b>root certificate </b> is issued by CA. When a windows system  opens a secure email or visits a secure website and encouters a new digital certificate,it requests microsoft trusted root certificate,which is downloaded to the computer.The download happens seamlessly without the user's knowledge unless there's a problem.If windows cannot obtain the root certificate to validate the email or website,it displays an error.Don't trust websites or email whose certificates has expired or been evoked
            <img alt="" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> <br></li>
            <p>You can use Certificate Mnnager <em> (certmgr.msc0 ) </em> to view and delete root certificates.The Superfish virus injects a rogue root certificate into Microsoft store of trusted certificates on the local computer so that it can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to display adware on secure websites a user visits.If you see a <b>Superfish ceritificate </b> listed among trusted root certificates,be sure to delete it 
            <img alt="" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> 
            
            </p>
           
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h6><b>STEP 2:</b> Quarantining an infected system</h6>
            <p>- If an infected computer is connected to a wired or wireless network,disconnect it from the network  or turn off the wireless adapter,you don't want to spread the virus to other computers in your network <br>
            - A <b>quarantined computer</b> is not allowed to use the same network as other computers,if you need to download anti-malware software or updates from the  internet,take some precautions.Can you disconnect other computers from the network while you are working on the infected computer?can you isolate the computer from your local network and connect it directly to your ISP or a special quarantined network?.Try to download the anti-malware software updates while the computer is booted in safe mode with networking or after clean boot ( Safe Mode doesn't always allow downloads ) Malware might still be running in safe mode or after a clean boot,but it's less likely to do so than when the system is started normally <br>
            - Always make sure data in the hard drive is backed up before you begin cleaning up the system,back up to another media</p>
            <div class="home-content-tools">
                <h6><b>STEP 3:Disabling system restore</b></h6>
                    <img alt="" style="width: 350px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                        <p style="margin-left: 360px;">
                           Some malware hides it's program in files in store points stored in the system volume information folder that's maintained by system protection.If system protection is on,anti-malware software can't clean this protected folder.To get rid of the malware,turn off the system protection so that anti-malware software can clean the system volume information folder. When you turn off system protection,all your restore points are lost,so first consider whether you might need those restore points to troubleshoot the malware infection before you disable system protection
                        </p>
                    </div>
            <p>
                To turn off System protection,go to <b>Control Panel</b>, open the <b>System </b> window, and click <b>System protection</b>, when you are done and you are sure the system is clean,turn System Protection back on and create new restore point that you can use in the future if problems arise 
            </p>
            <h6><b>STEP 4:</b> Remediating the infected system</h6>
            <p>
                List of popular ant-malware software for computers and programs, websites which also provide information about the malware.Before selecting a product,be sure to read some reviews about it and check out some reliable websites that rate anti-malware software

            <h6>When an infected computer will not boot</h6>
            <p>
                The boot manager,boot loader or kernel mode drivers lauched at startup might be infected or damaged.Lauch the computer into Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) and use the startup Repair process to repair the system.You can install the hard drive as a second drive in another system and use that system to scan the drive for malware
            </p>
            <h6>Update and run anti-malware software that's already installed</h6>
            <p>If anti-malware software is already installed on a system and you suspect an infection,update the software and perform a fill scan on the system.Do the following:
                <ul>
                    1. Make sure the anti-malware software is up to date.Updates download the latest malware definitions, also called malware signatures, which the software uses to define or detect new malware as it gets into the wild ( became available to the internet) <br>
                    2. Use the anti-malware to perform the full scan of the system,The software might ask you what to do with an infected program or it might log the event in an event viewer or history log it keeps.Windows defender reports a threat,when you click clean pc,you can decide what to do with the threat,select remove to delete the program <br>
                    3.After the scan has completed and you have decided what to do with each suspicious file,reboot the system,allow the software to update itself again and then scan the system again.It is likely that some new malware will be discovered,keep rebooting and rescanning until a scan comes up clean
                </ul>

        <h6>Run anti-malware software from a networked computer</h6>
        <p>
            If anti-malware is not installed,the most effective way to clean the computer is to run the software from another computer.Follow these steps:
            <ul>
                1. Make sure the remote computer has it's own software firewall set for maximum protection and it"s installed anti-malware software is up to date and running <br>
                2. Network the two computers and share drive C: on the infected computer. (Don't connect the infected computer to the entire network.If necessary, you can connect the two computers using a crossover cable or using a small switch and network cables) <br>
                3. To make your work easier,you can map a network drive from the remote computer to drive C: on the infected computer <br>
                4. Perform an anti-malware scan on the remote computer, pointing the scan to drive C: on the infected computer
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>Install and run anti-malware software on the infected computer</h6>
        <p>
            Use another computer to purchase and download anti-malware software and then copy the downloaded files to a CD or flash drive that you can insert in the infected computer.Don't make the mistake of  using the the infected computer to purchase  and download anti-malware software because keyloggers might be spying and collecting credit card information.During the installation process,the anti-malware software updates itself and performs a scan.You can also run a free online anti-malware software without downloading and installing it, but be careful to use only reputable websites
        </p>
        <h6>Install and run anti-malware software in safe mode</h6>
        <p>
            Some malware prevents anti-malware software from installing or running.Try booting the system in Safe Mode or perform a clean boot, and installing the anti-malware software.Some viruses still load in Safe Mode or after a clean boot and some anti-malware programs will not install in Safe Mode.Launch Safe Mode, enter the <b>msconfig</b>.In the system configuration box, click the boot tab and check Safe boot.To lauch Safe Mode with networking so that you can update your anti-malware software,select <b>Network</b> in the list of options,then restart the system
        </p>

        <h6>Run an anti-malware scan before windows boots</h6>
        <p>Microsoft offers scanning utility called <b>Windows Defender Offline (WDO) </b> that loads before windows and performs a scan in the <b>Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE)</b>. WinPE is a limited version of windows that can beused for customizing windows installations,modifying the windows installation while it's not running or performing recovery tasks.WDO can be started from the windows 10 settings app:
        <ul>
            1. Click Update and security,windows security and virus and threat protection <br>
            2. In Windows defender security center,click run a new advanced scan.Select windows defender offline scan.Make sure all apps and files are saved and closed,then click scan <br>
            <img alt="" style="width: 350px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> <br>
            3. After the scan completes,find information about the scan in the  Virus and threat protection windows by clicking threat history
        </ul>
        <p>If you are unable to boot into windows 10 or or ealier version of windows,use an uninfected computer to create a  bootable CD or flash drive with the WDO tool and then boot from that device:
            <ul>
                1. Download the 32-bit or 64-bitversion of WDO from the microsoft support website at the following link and save it to a CD or flash drive: <br>
                <em>support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/windows-defender-offline-help-protect-my-pc</em> <br>
                2. Boot from the WDO device,perform the scan and check the results.Other anti-malware companies offer preinstallation scanning tools,also called rescue disks or  bottable antivirus tools.Bitdefender Rescue CD <em> ( bitdefender.com ) </em> and Kaspersky's Rescue Disk <em> kaspersky.com</em>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>Run more than one scan of anti-malware software</h6>
        <p>
            After you have scanned the system using one of the methods just discussed,reboot and install anti-malware software on the hard drive.Update the software and then keep scanning and rebooting until the scan report is clean. <br> If a second or third scan doesn't remove all symptoms of malware,consider installing and running a second anti-malware progam.What one anti-malware cannot detect,the other might.try another anti-malware program ,microsoft safety scanner <br> <em> (docs.microsoft.com./en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download) </em> is not designed for ongoing malware prevention but can sometimes remove malware that windows defender did not find.Download and run the latest version of the software
        </p>
    <h6>Clean up what's left over</h6>
    <p>You will need to clean up anything the anti-malware software left behind.Sometimes anti-malware software tells you it is not able to delete a file or it deletes an infected file but leaves behind an orphaned entry in the registry or startup folders.First check the anti-malware software website for any instructions you might find to manually clean things up.Here are some general actions you can take to clean up what the software left behind
        <ul>
            1 <b>Respond to any startup errors.</b> on the first boot after the anti-malware software has declared a system clean,you might still find some startup errors caused by incomplete removal of the malware.Use system configuration or Task manager to find out how a startup program is lauched.If the program is lauched from the registry,you can back up and delete the registry key.If the program is lauched from a startup folder,you can move or delete the shortcut or program in the folder <br>
            2 <b> Research malware types and program files.</b> Anti-malware software might alert you to a suspecious program file that it quarantines and then ask youu to decide if you want to delete it.Task Manager and other tools might find processes you suspect are malware.The web is your best tool to use when making your decision about a program.Here are some websites that offer malware encyclopedias that are reliable aand give you symptoms and solutions <br> 
            &ang; Process Library by ProcessLibrary at <em>processlibrary.com</em> <br>
            &ang; DLL Library by Unible Systems Limited at <em>liutilities.com</em> <br>
            &ang; All the anti-malware software sites listed earlier <br>
            Beware of using other sites! Much information on the web is written by people who are just guessing and some of the information is put there to purposefully deceive.Check thinngs out carefully and learn which sites you can rely on
            3 <b>delete files</b> Each program that the anti-malware software couldn't delete,delete those programs yourself by following these steps: <br>
                <ul>
                    a. Try file explorer or windows explorer to locate a file and delete it.don't forget to empty the recycle bin when you are done<br>
                    b. If the file is hidden or access denied,open elevated command prompt window  and use the following commands,to take control of a file so you can delete it.If the commands don't work using an elevated command ptompt windows,use the commands in a command prompt windows in windows RE <br>

                    c. Delete all internet exploer temporary internet files.Use disk cleanup process in the drive C: property box, or delete the browsing history using the internet option box <br>
                    d. Delete all subfolders and files in the C:Windows\Temp folder (where windows defender lists potentially unwanted programs <b>PuPs</b> that a trojan downloader put in this folder )

            <img alt="" style="width: 350px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> <br>
            4. <b>Clean the registry</b> Search for folders and registry keys that can affect startup and delete those you don't want. After you have finished cleaning startup folder and registry,don't forget to start the system and make sure all is well before you move on <br>
            5. <b>Clean up your browsers and uninstall unwanted programs </b> Adware and spyware might install add-ons to a browser,install cookie trackers and change your browser security settings.Anti-malware software might have found all these items,but as a good defense,take few minutes  to find out for yourself.You can uninstall unwanted toolbars,plug-ins and other software using the programs and features windows <br>

            <h6><b>STEP 5: Protecting the system with scheduled scans and updates</b></h6>
            <p>Once your system is clean, you will want to keep it that way.Three best practices to protect a system against malware are :</p>
            <ul>
               <b>Use anti-malware software</b> <br>Install and run anti-malware software and keep it current.Configure it so that  the software runs in the backgroud in real time to alert users of malware trying to filtrate the system.Automatic scans incoming email attachments and perform scheduled scans of the system and automatically downloads updates to the software.To find out what anti-malware software installed and turned on,open Windows and maintenance in control panel<br>
                <img alt="" style="width: 450px;" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" /> <br>
                <b> Always use a software firewall</b> <br> Never connect your computer to an unprotected network without using firewall.Windows firewall is turned on by default <br>
                <b>keep windows updates current</b> <br> Microsoft continually releases updates to plug vulnerable entrances in windows where malware might attact and updates to windows defender and mocrosoft security essentials
            </ul>
            <h6><b>STEP 6: Enabling stsem protection and creating a restore point</b></h6>
            <p>Now that the system is clean,you can turn on System Protection if necessary and create a restore ppoint.</p>
            <h6><b>STEP 7: Educating the end user</b></h6> <br>It's a good time to sit down with the user and go over the tips presented earlier to keep the system free from malware.Sometimes the most overlooked step in preventing malware infections is to educate the user.Even if all your security measures are in place,a user can still download and execute a Trojan,which can install more malware in the system
