            <h4>Best practices for documentation and security policies</h4>
            <h6>Types of documentation</h6>
            <p>
                Well run IT department rely on documentation and security policies to set expectations and standards for security in the entire organization.Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that documents what you can do and  can't do in the corporate resource,password policy that documents how to create password.Other types of documentation an IT techinian might encouter in an organization  
            </p>
            <li> <b>Knowledge base</b> <br>Is a collection of pictures,texts,videos that give information about the             network,product,or service :
                <ul>  
                    1. <b>Customer service</b>. To support customers,an organization could publish a knowledge base about it's product or services on their website,Technical support ussually have access to this type of documentation to aid in helping customers during support calls,knowledge base might be intergrated into a ticketing system  <br>
                    2. <b>IT training and troubleshooting</b>. Install,configure and troubleshoot devices and software,the information they learn can be documented in the IT department's knowledge base so it's readily available for future troubleshooting and for training  new IT personnel
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>  <b>Inventory management</b>. Documents inventory,including end-user devices,network devices,IP addresses,software licenses and other related licenses.Hardware inventory might be using asset tags and theft prevention plates.These tags and plats contain barcodes that are easily read by laser scanner.Asset tracking software can scan the barcodes to report exixting inventory,track equipment,report needed maintenance and help identify stolen property.</li>
            <li>  <b>Password policy</b> What is documented in this documentation is how to create a strong password and best practices for password (allowing password to expire so the user can be forced to change it ) </li>
            <li> <b>Network topology diagrams</b>  Network documentation should include a map of network topology.Topology refers to the pattern in which devices on a network are connected to each other <br>
            - Devices connected in a line are using bus topology <br> - Devices connected to a single,centralized device are using star bus topology.<br>
                The diagram might show how nodes on a network are physically connected or it might show the logical network topology.<br>
                On a small network,the diagram can be hand drawn but on large networks,inventory data is ussually compiled automatically through network scans.Spiceworks <em> ( spiceworks.com ) </em> offers free network inventory product that probes devices on the network and presents a list of detected devices along with any information gathered about them,such as IP addresses,OS, and shared  folders
            </li>

            <h6>Change management</h6>
            <p>
                You will be involved in new projects such as installing hardware or software,upgrading networks,moving IT operations from onsite services to cloud-based services,rolling out virtualized desktops across the organization,implementing a VoIP communication platform and much more.A project has the beginning, end and other steps broken down in sessions ( <b>  Period</b> of the project) and a well defined goal.A successful project depends on expert project management  to direct a project team through specific tasks and deliver results on time,within the agreed -to budget and with complete customer satisfaction<br>Change managed well means that people affected by the change can make a smooth transaction from their current state to the project goal or end results.Change management is closeely intergrated with project management and is often involves the same teams.A project manager works with the team to plan,develop,test,and implement new software.A Change manager might work with the same team to define how the software will affect people and manage all communication,schedule,training and support required so that affected people are satisfied,embracing and accepting the end result
            </p>
            <h6>Documented business processes</h6>
            <p>
                A business is complex and well-run organization know they must understand and document their core business goals and their processes <br>Documented business processes are related activities that lead to a desired business goals, such as an efficient and cost-effective services,excellent customer satisfaction or superior product.If customer satisfaction is a defined business goal,IT operational processes might describe how customers are taken care of.Be aware of how change affects documented business processes.
            </p>
            <h6>Purpose of change</h6>
            <p>What will change? What is the current situation and expected outcome? Why is the change needed? What happens if the organization does not initiate this change? How will the succes of the change be measured?</p>
            <h6>Scope of the change</h6>
            <p>Key components of the change,how they will be addressed,skill set required,tasks and activities to be required to carry out thus change,individuals or departments involved,how will success be measured and when the change has been  been completed,resposibilities of each,planning and implementation</p>
            <h6>Risk Analysis</h6>
            <p>All problems you might come across,that may occur or not occur as a result of the change,alienating customers,not finishing in time,impact that could take place,not delivering the intenden results,all problems and solutions incase the problem arise,team for each problem where it will rise,how it might occur,it's impact,what to do if it happens</p>
            <h6>Back out of the plan</h6>
            <p>What if the change goes bad,what will happen if the server dgoed down,plan defines activities needed for the roll back if the implementation is to fail,created and tested before the roll out is implmented</p>
            <h6>End user acceptance</h6>
            <p>User must know the purpose of the change,the leadership of the company must agree with the change,how the the change affact them and their jobs,how to get questions and answer session with the user,how will the roll out occur,how will the end-user training be scheduled,how will they be notified of the change,request for comment (RFC) feedback before the change </p>
            <h6>Documenting everything</h6>
            <p>No part of change management should rely on spoken communication only,Everything related to changes must be documented,including how will the change it self works.Change plans are documented and updated throughout the entire change management process.Many large organizations use chanege management softwares such as Alloy software <em>allow-software.com</em> to manage all stages of change management from the change request  form to the final close report.Small organizations may manually document changes using MS word or Excel documents or database software,you will be expected to maintain proper documentation for all stages of a change in which you participate in.As soon as everything is tested,get signature from the stakeholders to give you a go ahead-as you carry the change,document everything,IP address,usernames and passwords,label work stations</p>

                           As an IT technician,you need to be aware of the issues concerning software licensing. Open source software can be freely distributed and installed, but closed source software is owned by the creator (developer) and a license is required to use the software.When someone purchase a software,they only purchased a commecial license for the software,which is the right to use it but it doesn't cover distributing it.The right to copy the work, called <b>copyright</b>, belongs to the creator of the work or others to whom the creator transfers this right

                <li><b>Identify and go through proper channels</b> When you believe a crime has been committed or infringement of the law, or company code of conduct,where do you report the issue, make sure you go only through proper channels,don't spread rumours or accusations</li>
                <li><b>Preserve data and devices</b> What data or device should you preserve as evidence for what you believe has happened.

            <h6>Data destruction and disposal</h6>
            <p>
                You need to destroy data before you throw out a hard drive,flash drive,CD,DVD,tape or other media that might have personal or corporate data on it,unless you know the data can't be stolen off the device.Trying to wipe a drive clean by deleting files or even by using windows to format the drive does not completely destroy the data.Remember dumpster diving? consider this as impact of digital dumpster diving.here are some ways to destroy printed documents and sanitize storage devices:
                <li><b>For solid-state devices,use a secure erase utility</b> For personal data privacy,the American National Standards Institude (ANSI) developed  the <b>ATA Secure Erase</b> standards to wipe clean a solid-state device such as USB flash drive or SSD.You can download a secure erase utility from the manufacturer of the device and run it to sanitize the drive, or you can securely erase all data on the device and then reuse or dispose of it</li>
                <li><b>Physically distroy the storage media</b> Use a drill to drill many holes all the way through the drive housing.Break CDs and DVDs in half and do similar physical damage with a hammer to flash drives or tapes,even to the point of setting them on fire to incinerate them.An expert thieves can still recover  some of the data</li>
                <li><b>For magnetic devies,use a degausser</b> Exposes a storage device to a strong electromagnetic field to completely erase the data ona magnetic hard drive  or tape drive.A degaussed drive can't be reused but for the best destruction,use the degausser and physically destroy the drive.Degausser doesn't erase data on a solid-state hard drive or other flash media because these devies don't use magnetic surfaces to hold data</li>
                <li><b>Use a shredder</b> You can use paper shredder to destrol all documents that contain sensitive data.The  best paper shredders apply multiple passes to cross-cut the paper rather than than strip cutting.Many paper shredders can handle credit cards or thin cardboard.<b>Multimedia shredders</b> can also destroy optical discs.Disk shredders from Whitaker Brothers <em>whitakerbrothers.com</em> can destroy magnetic hard drives,solid-state drives,flash drives,optical discs and even mobile devices  such as smartphones or small tablets</li>
                <li><b>Use a secure data-destruction service</b> Fort the very best data descrution,consider a secure data-descruction service.To find a service,search the web for "secure data destruction". Don't use a service unless you have  thoroughly checked it's references and guarantees of legal compliant that your organization is required  to meet.The service should privide you with a digital certificate of destruction, which verifies that data has been destroyed beyond recovery.Paper certificates can be forged but digital certificates produced by the software that performs the destcruction will provide auditable results of the destruction process </li>
