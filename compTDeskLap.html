                            Laptops come in several varieties,including some with touch screen that allows you to handwrite on it with a stylus and some with a rotating or removable screen that allows you to use a laptop as a tablet.Another variety of a laptop is <b> netbook </b> which is smaller and less expensive than laptop and has fewer features. An <b>All in one computer</b> has the monitor and computer case built in together and uses components that are common both on laptop and desktop.All in one computers use many laptop components and are serviced in similar ways

                    A laptop provides ports on it's sides,back or front for connecting peripherals.Ports common to laptops as well as desktop systems include USB,network and audio ports (for microphone,headset or external speakers ). Video ports might include one or more VGA,displayPort,thunderbolt(on Apple laptops ) or HDMI ports to connect to a projector,second monitor or television.On the side or back of the laptop, youi will see a lock connector that's used to physically secure the laptop with a  cablelock and DC jack to receive power from the AC adapter.Also a laptop might have optical drive but usually netbooks don't have them.There slots which are used for for flash memory flash memory card: <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('We test our project three times before submition');" >MagicGate slot</a> and <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('We test our project three times before submition');" >SD card slot</a>.Each can support several types of flash memory cards but if your laptop does't have the ports and slots,you need to find USB dongle to provide the ports or slot. <b>Here are some possible solutions for a miussing or failed port:</b>

                <h4>Special considerations when supporting laptop</h4>
                    <p>
                        Laptops ant their replacement parts cost more than they do for desktop computer even though they have the similar features.Laptop components are expensive as they are designed to be more compact and stand up to travel,laptops use compact hard drives,small memory module and CPU's that require less power than regular desktops.Desktop components is often assembled from parts made by a variety of manufacturers as for laptops are always sold by ventor that either manufactured the laptop or had it moanufactured as a consolidated system.It's easy to install components from different ventors for desktop computer where as laptop components have factors to put into considerations like manufacturer warranty,the service manual and diagnostic software provided by the manufacturer,the customised operating system that is unique to laptops and the need to order replacement parts directly from the laptops manufacturer or other source authorised by manufacturer.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        The task of maintaining,upgrading and troubleshooting a laptop require the sake skillset,knowledge and procedures as when servicing a desktop computer.however you should take special consideration into account when caring for,supporting,upgrading and troubleshooting laptops.The same concerns apply to netbooks and all-in-one computers
                    </p>
                <h6>Warranty concerns</h6>
                <p>
                    Most manufactures or retailers of laptops offer at least one year warranty and the option to purchase an extended warranty.When laptop issues arise while the laptop is in warranty,you are dealing with a single manufacturer or retailer to get support or parts.After the laptop is out of warranty,this manufactureer or retailer can still be your one-stop shop  for support and parts<em>Warranty often implies to all components in the system,but it can be voided if someone other than an authorised service center representative services the laptop.As a service technician you have to be very careful not to void a warranty that the customer has purchased.Warranties can be voided by opning the case,removing parts labels,installing other vendor parts,upgrading the OS or disassembling the system unless directly instructed to do so by authorized service center personnel</em><br>Before you begin to service a laptop,avoid potential problems with warranty by always asking the customer "Is the laptop under  warranty? "If the laptop is under warranty,look under documentation to find out how to get technical support.Options are chat sessions on the web,phone call and emails.Before contactingthe technical support,have the laptop model and serial number ready.You will also need the name,phone number and address of the person or company that made the purchase.Consider asking the customer for a copy of the receipt and warranty so you will have the information you need to talk to the support 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the type of warranty purchased by the laptop's owner ,the manufacturer might send an on-site service technician,ask you to ship the laptop or take the laptop to an authorized service center or help you to solve the problem by online chat session or over the phone.<br><b>The following table is a list of  manufactures and it's website of the most popular laptops,netbooks and all-in-one computers</b>

                    Desktop computers tend to be similar to one another,and components in destop systems are usually interchangeable among manufacturers.That is not the case when coming to laptops.Laptop manufacturers tend to be creating their own unique computer cases, buses, cables, connectors, drives, circuit boards, fans and even screws, all  of which tend to be proprietary in design<br>Every laptop case model has a unique case.Components are installed in unique ways and opening the case for each laptop model is done differently,for that reason,servicing a laptop can be very complicated and time consuming.For example a hard drive on a laptop is accessed by popping open a side panel and sliding the drive out of the bay and other laptops models to access the hard drive,you must remove the keyboard <b>It is always adviseble to visit the manufacturer website or manual if you are not familiar with the model</b> to avoid damaging the case frame or plastics as you pry and push trying to open it <b>Trial and error is likely to damage the case</b> even though you might be able to replace broken components,it will result in an unhappy customer

                <h6>Diagnostic tools provided by manufacturer</h6>
                <p>
                    Most laptop manufactures provide diagnostic software that can help you test  components to determine which components to replace.<br><b>Steps to servicing a laptop</b>
                    <ul>
                        <em> &ang; Check user manual, service manual or manufacture website to chechk if diagnostic software exist and how to use it</em><br>
                        <em> &ang; Use the software to pin point the problem component, which can be replaced</em><br>
                        <em> &ang; Check manufacturer's website for diagnostic software that can be downloaded for specific laptop model or store on hard drive or on cd bundled with the laptop</em></ul>
                        <p>One of the most recommended diagnostic software is <b>PC-Doctor</b> <em>( pc-doctor.com) </em>.The software can be stored on CD or Hard drive,on CD you can boot from the cd to run the test.If the software is stored on hard drive,you can run it from Windows Start menu or by pressing a function key at start up before Windows loads.PC-Doctor can run on keyboard, video, speakers, touch pad, optical drive, wireless LAN, motherboard, processor, ports, hard drive and memory.You can find a stand-alone version of PC-Doctor for DOS  and PC -Doctor  for windows at <em>pc-doctor.com</em>,it is <b>Expensive</b> it's worth it if you want to service laptops

                <h4>Working on the inside of Laptop computer</h4>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it is necessary to open a laptop case so you can upgrade memory,exchange a hard drive or replace a failed component such as LCD panel, video inverter, keyboard, touch pad, processor, optical drive DC jack, fan, motherboard, CMOS Battery, Mini PCIe card, wireless card or speaker.Today laptops are made so that it could be easy to exchange memory modules or hard drives.However replacing motherboard or processor can be a very complex process,taking several hours,it could be much easier to replace the entire laptop and cost effective than replacing motherboard or processor.Screws and nuts on a laptop are smaller than those on a desktop system and therefore require smaller tools
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on a laptop requires lot of patiece as with desktop system,before you start opening the case of a laptop or touching sensitive components,you should always wear an ESD strap.You can attach the allegator clip end to an unpainted metallic surface on the laptop,like port of a laptop at the back.If a ground strap is not available,you can dissipate any ESD between you and the laptop by touching a metallic,unpainted part of it,such as port on the back, before you touch a component inside the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Laptops consist of many screws in different size and length.When removing the screws,make sure you label the screws so that when you reassemble the laptop,you won't mismatch the screws <b>to avoid damaging components by</b> taking the screw to the wrong hole or small hole<br><b>Methods you can use</b><br>
                    <ul>
                        <em>Place screws in a pillbox with each compartment labeled.</em><br>
                        <em>Place the screws on a soft,padded work surface and use white labeling tape to label each set of screws</em><br>
                        <em>Put the screws on  a notebook paper and write besite them where the screw belong</em>.
                    </ul>   
                        Any method you use, work methodically to keep screws and components organized so you know what goes where when you reassemble 
                </p>
       <p>
        When you disassembling a computer but don't have user manual
           <li>Keep notes as you work,it will help you later when you reassemble the computer</li>
           <li>Draw diagrams and label things carefully, include cable orientation and screws location in your diagram</li>
           <li>Use digital camera,take photos as you work,for each step in the process of disassembling the computer</li>
       </p>

                    <h6>Tips to consider when disassembling a laptop computer</h6>
                        <li>
                            Find the hardware manual for the model you are working on,the manual should include all steps to take when diassembling the laptop and list of parts that can be ordered from the manufacturer.if you can't find the manual,try video tutorials about the same model on the internet
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Consider the warranty of the laptop before you open it,remember that opening the case will void the warranty.Make sure components you purchased to replace on the laptop will work on the model you are servicing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take your time.Patience is needed to make sure you don't scratch,marring plastic screw covers,hinges and the case
                        </li>
                        <li>Don't force anything because it will result in breaking things</li>
                        <li>Always wear ESD strap or use other protection against ESD </li>
                        <li>
                            When working on cables,bare in mind that some ribbon cable connectors  are are <b>ZIF connectors</b>. To disconnect ZIF connector,pull up on the connector then remove the cable.For some ribbon connectors you simply pull the cable out of the connector.For these cables,it's best to use two tweezers,one on each side of the connector,to remove the cable 
                        </li>
                        <li>Use spudger,dental pick or small screwdriver to pry up the plastic cover hiding the screws</li>
                        <li>
                            Some laptops use plastic screws that are only intended to be used only once,be careful not to overtighten these screws.Always use new screws when reassemble the laptop
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Disassemble the laptop by removing each field replaceable unit (FRU) in the order given by the model manual
                            <ul>
                                Manufacture might say: to replace the fan assembly and heat sink assembly of the laptop,you must you must remove components in this order:HDD compartment cover,keyboard bezel,HDD, Mini PCIe slot compartment cover, RAM, wireless card, optical drive and the system board 
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                After removing all these compoments then you can remove fan assembly and heat sink assembly.Follow these steps to remove each component in the correct order
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once all the appropriate covers and screws are removed,you must<em> crack the case</em> meaning you separate the top and bottom parts of the case.The parts might be tight,to separate them,use a plastic or metal spudger to slide along the seal and pry open the case
                        </li>
                        <h6 style="margin-top: 60px;">Tips to consider when reassembling a laptop computer</h6>
                        <li>Reasssemble the laptop in the reverse order you disassembled it.Follow each step carefully </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure you tighten the screws but not overtighten them.Loose screws or metal fragments in a laptop can be very dangerous,they might cause a short as they shift about inside the laptop
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Before you install battery,make sure there are no loose parts inside the laptop.gently shake it,if you haer anything loose, open the case, find the loose component, screw,s pring or metal flake and fix the problem

                <h4>Exploring laptop internal components</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here is a list of important components you are likely to be instructed to remove when you disassenble a laptop ant the typical order to remove them.However know that the components and the order of diassembly vary from one laptop to another:
                    </p>
        
                    <li><b><em>Remove or disable the battery pack</em></b> Disconnect all peripherals,remove discs in the optical drive, and shut down the system,Then disconnect the AC adapter and remove battery.Removing the battery assures you that there is no power getting to the system,which keeps the laptop and you safe as you work.In the case where laptop or netbook has a built in battery,follow manufacturer instructions to disable the battery</li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the hard drive</em></b> Some laptops hard drive is accessed by removing the cover from the bottom of the laptop.The hard drive is secured by at least three screws.Remove the screws and disconnect the ribbon cable,For other hard drives,rather than disconnecting a ribbon cable from the drive,you unplug the drive from it's drive socket </li>
                <li><b><em>Remove memory</em></b> Laptops use smaller memory module than the DIMMs used in desktop computers.<b>SO-DIMM</b> ( small Outline DIMM) is size for laptops.Start by removing the memory/Mini PCI Express card compartment cover to access the memory modules.Release two latches on both edges of the socket at the same time to remove the memory modules </li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the wireless card</em></b> The Mini PCIe wireless card is stored in the same compartment module as the memory.Disconnect the two wires leading to the wireless antennas,which is installed in the laptop lid.Remove the screw securing the wireless card then pull the card directly away from the socket  </li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the optical drive</em></b> The optical drive is secured by a single screw on the bottom of the laptop.Slide the drive out of the case </li>
                    <li><b><em>Crack the case</em></b> After removing compartment covers and the components accessible inside these compartment ( Memory,obtical drive, and hard drive) you are ready to remove any other screws as directed in the service manual, and you can crack the case.Use spudger to slide along the seal between the case top and bottom and pry open the plastic casing on the side </li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the keyboard bezel</em></b> Keyboard bezel is the keyboard casing surrounding the keyboard of a laptop.For some laptops, remove the case top and then remove the keyboard.Once you remove screws and disconnect the cables from the motherboard,keyboard bezel should easily lift away from the laptop.You might need a spudger to help </li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the system board</em></b> In The documentation,laptop motherboard is usually called the system board, with a heat sink,fan and processor connected to it.A system board in a laptop also has ports on one side that are easily accessed externally onthe laptop.To remove the system board,you must remove all screws and disconnect all cables for all the components in the laptop which can be time comsuming and difficult</li>
                    <li><b><em>Remove the CPU,Heat sink and Fan</em></b> The CPU is embedded on the system board in many laptops,which means if the CPU fails,the system board must be replaced to repair the laptop.the heat sink draws heat from the CPU and pipes it to the fan.The fan blows the heat out of the laptop case.The fan and heat sink assembly is considered a field replaceable compponent inmany laptops</li>
