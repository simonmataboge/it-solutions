                <h4>Technologies and form factors of hard drives</h4>
                <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                <p>Two types of hardware technologies used inside the drive are magnetic and solid-state.Some hybrid drive use the combination of both technologies.Each hard drive technology uses several form factors.</p>
                <h6>Magnetic hard drives</h6>
                <p>
                    A magnetic hard drive has one,two, or more platters or disks that are stack together and spin in unison inside  a sealed metal housing that contains firmware to cotrol reading and writing data to the drive and communicate with the  motherboard.The top bottom of each disk have read/write head that modes across the disk surface as all the disks rotate on a spindle.Read/erite heads are only controlled by an actuator which moves the read/write heads across the disk surface in unison.The spindle rotates at 5400, 7200or 15,000 RPM(revolutions per minutes). The faster the spindle,the better the drive perfoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data is organised on a magnetic hard drive in concentric circles called tracks.Each track is divided into segments called sectors,also called records.The older hard drives used sectors that contained 512 bytes.Current hard drivers use 4096-byte sector<br>Form factors for internal magnetic hard drives are 3,5 inch for desktops and 2,5 inch for laptop computers.A smaller 1,8 hard  drive and other equipments such as MP3 players
                </p>

                <h6>Solid-state drives</h6>
                <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
                <p>
                    A <b>Solid-state drives</b> also called a solid-state device it is because it has no moving parts.The drives are built using nonvolatile memory,which is similar to that used for USB flash drives and smart cards.This type of drive does not loose data even if it is powered off.Flash memory is stored on chips on the circuit board inside the hard drive.The chip contains grids of crows and column of two transistors at each inersection. One of these transistors is called a floating gate and accepts 1 and 0 state according to a logic test called NAND(Not AND).The memory in an ssd is called NAND flash memory Transistors are limited to number of times they can be reprogrammed, it's life span is based on number of write operations to the drive and can be expressed as TBW( TeraBytes Written) or DWPD(Drive Writes Per Day) over expected life.Hard Drive life span is only five years.SSD hard drive is much expensive compared to magnetic hard drive of the same capacity but they are fast,more reliable,last longer and use less power than magnetic drives.<br><b>The following are three form factors used by SSD</b>
                    <ul> 
                        <em>&ang; <b>2.5" SSD.the 2.5 " SSd is used in desktops and laptops and can mount in the same bays and use the same cable connectors as those used by 2.5" magnetic drives</b></em><br>
                        <em>&ang; <b>M.2 SSD card</b>Form factor is a small M.2 card that uses the motherboard M.2 slot</em><br>
                        <em>&ang; <b>PCI Express SSD expansion card.</b> An SSD can be embedded on a PCIe expansion card,they have faster interface with the CPU than 2.5" SSD and may also be faster than an M.2 SSD,depending on how the M.2 slot interface with the CPU.A PCIe SSD uses the NVMs</em>
                    </ul>

                <h6>Hybrid hard drives</h6>
                <p>
                    A <b>Hybrid hard drive (H-HDD</b> also calles solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD) contains both magnetic and SSD technologies.The magnetic drive in the drive housing permanently holds data while flash components serves as a buffer to improve drive performance.Some hybrid drives perform just as well as an SSD .For hybrid drive to function,the operating system must support it.

                            Most hard drives today use SATA interface standards to connect to the motherboard.The Serial ATA pronounced say-ta standard uses a serial data path and a SATA data cable can accomodate a single SATA drive.SATA is used by all types of drives,including hard drives,CD,DVD and Blu-ray.It supports hot-swapping also called hot plugging.

                            You can connect and disconnect a drive while the system is running.Hard drives that are hot swapped,are more expensive than regular hard drives and are used in servers or other network storage devices.A SATA drive connects to one internal SATA connector on the motherboard by way of 7-pin SATA datacable and uses 15-pin SATA power connector.An internal SATA data cable can be up to one meter in lenth.Motherboard might have two or more SATA connectors.<b>The three SATA standards are:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <em> &ang; SATA1 or SATA III, rated at 6 Gb/sec.is sometimes called SATA 6 Gb/sec</em><br>
                                <em> &ang; SATA2 or SATA II,rated at 3 Gb/sec,sometimes called SATA 3 Gb/sec</em> <br>

                            </ul>
                        The SATA 3.2 revision allows for PCIe and SATA to work together in a technology called <b>SATA Express</b> which uses a new SATA connector.The speed of SATA Express is about three times that os SATA 3.0 but not as fast as NVM.Investment in SATA express has been very slow,as a result manufacturers have only few motherboards that have SATA Express slot.For internal connetors,motherboard and expansion card provide <b>external SATA (eSATA)</b> ports for external drives.External drives use special external shielded SATA cable up to two meters long.7-pin eSATA ports use the same speed as internal ports SATAI, II, III standards.eSATA ports are shaped differently from internal SATA connectors as to prevent people from using insheilded internal SATA data cable with eSATA ports

                    When selecting a hard  drive,keep in mind that to get the best performance from the system,the motherboard and drive must support the same interface standards.If they don't support the standards,the will revert to the slower standard that both can use or the drive will not work at all.When making a purchase,you need to make sure you know the standard for the motherboard slot or ports and expansion card that might provide the drive interface.Find out by reading motherboard manual.<br><b>Here are some options for compatibility</b>
                    <ul>
                        <em> &ang; SATA ports are usually color-coded to differentiate between SATA standards the pors support.Motherboard has mix of SATA3,SATA2 ports.</em><br>

                    SATA might have jumpers used to set features such as the ability to power up from standby mode,if there are jumpers in a hard drive,the factory has set them as they should be and <b> you are advised</b> not to change them.Some hard drives have two SATA power connectors,Choose one of the power connectors but <b>never</b> use both connectors sametime as it might damage the drive

                    <b>Step 1: Protect user data</b>
                    <p>
                        First thing you do is to always remember to prioritise user data.Engage with the user to find out if the user has important data on the drive or has it been backed up before you start working.Use another drive to back up the data and verify if the data is saved, test it on a different media 
                    </p>

                    <b>Step 2 Know your starting point; </b>
                    <p>
                        Make sure you know your starting point before you start installing a hard drive.Verify which system device is working before you installing a new one.Keeping notes it's always a good idea when installing a new hardware or software or making any changes to your computer system.Write down what you know about the system that might be important later

                    <p>
                        Before you start working,read documentation for all drives,motherboard and even the case itself if you have to.Keep searching until you have all the answers,you can search on the web,technical support chats,knowledge from someone with more experience and most importantly make sure you know about the warranty the computer has.Prepare all your tools and working space,remember ESD straps, or mat during installation.You also need to avoid working on a carpet when there's lot of static electricity.<br> <b>Here are some precausions for working with a hard drive</b>
                        <ul>
                            <em>  &ang; Handle the drive with care</em><br>
                            <em>  &ang; Do not touch any exposed circuits or chips</em><br>
                            <em>  &ang; Prevent people from touching exposed microchips on the drive</em><br>
                            <em>  &ang; Touch the package containing drive screws holding an expansion card or cover or metal part of the computer case,for at least two seconds.This will drain all static electricity from the package and from your body</em><br>
                            <em>  &ang; if you must set down the drive outside the static protective package,place it component-side-up on a flat surface</em><br>
                            <em>  &ang; Do not place the drive on the computer case cover or on a metal table</em>
                        </ul>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 4: Install the  drive</b>
                    <p>Now that you are ready to install the drive,follow these steps to install the drive</p>
                    <ul>Follow best practices  for opening a computer case</ul>
                    <ul>Examine which bay will be able to hold the drive based on the length of the data cable and power cords.Make sure data cable can reach the motherboard  connectors or rearrange your plan and purchase a custom lenth data cable.Some bays are stationary meaning the drive is installed inside the bay because it stays inthe case,while other bays are removable,you can remove the bay,install the drive in it and then return the bay to the case </ul>
                    <ul>For stationary bay,slide the drive in the bay  and use a screw driver to secure one side of the drive with one or two screws.Some bays provide on or two tabs that you pull out before you slide the drive in the bay and then push to secure the drive.Another option is  a sliding tab that is used to secure the drive.Pull the tab back,slide the drive and push the tab forward to secure the drive</ul>
                    <ul>When using the screws,carefully turn the case over without disturbing the drive and put one or two screws on the other side of the drive.To best secure the drive in the case,use two screws on each side of the drive</ul>
                    <ul>Check motherboard documentation to find out which SATA connectors on the board to use first.If the SATA connectors are color-coded,it will explain which color is for which SATA connectors.A SATA cable might provide a clip to secure the cable</ul>
                    <ul>Connect a 15-pin SATA power connector or 4-pin Molex power connector from the power supply to the drive</ul>
                    <ul>Check all your connections and power up the system</ul>
                    <ul>To verify that the drive was recognized correctly,enter BIOS/UEFI setup and look for the drive.You can install hard drive on the faster connector and DVD drive on the slow SATA connector</ul>
                </li>
             <p>
                 If you are installing a new drive in the system that  will be used for a new windows installation,boot from the windows DVD or USB drive,follow the directions on the screen to install windows on the drive.If you are installing a second hard drive to the system that already has windows,use disk management utility in windows to prepare the drive for the first use (partitioning and formatting the drive)

                <p>Always see the documentation before you purchase and install an internal hard  drive or optical drive in a laptop.Check specific capacity,form factor and connectors that will fit the laptop.Before you decide to replace the drive,consider these issues
                    <ul> &ang; Be aware of voiding a warranty if you do not follow the laptop manufacturer's directions</ul>
                    <ul> &ang; If the old drive has crashed,you will need to recover media to reinstall windows and the drivers.Make sure you have all the tools to do that before you start working</ul>
                <ul> &ang; If you are upgrading from low capacity to high capacity drive,you need to work out a way on how will you transfer data from old drive to new drive.</ul></p>
                <p>Here is what you need to know when purchasing new hard drive for a laptop
                <ul> &ang; Purchase a hard drive recommended by the laptop manufacture.The drive might be magnetic or SSD and you will need a 2.5' or 1.8' drive.Some high end laptops use an M.2 SSD</ul>

                <h6>Setting up hardware RAID</h6>
                <img alt="" src="mwserve21-removebg-preview.png" />
            <p>A technology that uses two or three hard drives to work togetehr as an array of devices is called <b>RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disk ) or <b>redundant array of independent disks</b></b> Two reasons you might consider RAID are:</p>
            <ul>To improve performance by writting data to two or more hard drives so that a single drive is not excessively used</ul>
            <ul>To improve<b> fault tolerance</b>, which is a computer's ability to respond to a fault such as hardware failure or power outage,so that data is not lost.If data is important,you can write data on two hard drives simultaniously.This method is usually used in data centers,file servers but not commonly used in single workstations</ul>
            </div>
        <h6>Types of RAID</h6>
        <p>
            &ang; <b>Spanning</b> also called (JBOD-Just a Bunch of disks ) uses two hard drives to hold a single windows volume.Data is written to the first drive and then when it is full,data continue to be written in second drive.The purpose of spanning is to increase the disk space available for a single volume<br>
            &ang; <b>RAID 0</b> also uses two or more hard drives to increase disk space available for a single volume.Write to the physical disks across both disks so that neither receives all the activities.This improves performance.it is also called striped volume.(Data written across the drives or several drives) RAID 0 is prefarred to spanning<br>
            &ang; <b>RAID 1 </b> Is a type of mirroring that duplicates data from one drive to another  and is used for fault tolerance.Each drive has it's own volume and two volumes are called mirror,if one drive fail,the other drive will kick up and operate.Hot swapping is allowed in RAID 1,also called mirrored volume<br>
            &ang; <b>RAID 5</b> Strips data and parity information across three or more drives and uses parity checking.so that if one drive fails,the other drives re-create the data stored on the failed drive by using parity information.Data is not duplicated and therefore RAID 5 makes better use of volume capacity.RAID 5 increase performance and provide fault tolerance.Hot swapping is allowed in RAID 5,also called RAID 5 volume<br>
            &ang; <b>RAID 10 </b> also called <b>RAID 1+0</b> pronounced RAID one zero<b>(not RAID ten)</b>.is a combination of RAID 0 and RAID 1. It takes at least  drives for RAID 10.Data is mirrored across pair of disks, the two pairs are striped, it the most expensive solution that provides the best redundancy and performance and allows for hot swapping<br>
        </p>
        <p>All RAID configurations can be accomplished at the hardware level called hardware RAID or at operating system level called application RAID.You can use Disk management utility to group hard drives in a RAID array.Windows also offer storage spaces utility to implememt software RAID.but software RAID is considered unstable solution and is not recommended by Microsoft.Configuring RAID at hardware level is considered the best practice because if windows get corrupted,the hardware is still able to protect data and it is also faster than software RAID</p>
        <h6>How to implement hardware RAID</h6>
        <p>Hardware RAID can be implemented in a RAID enabled motherboard that is managed in BIOS/UEFI setup,or by using RAID controlled card.When using the RAID card,use the software that comes with the card to set up your RAID array.<br>For best performance in ay RAID system, all hard drives in an array should be identical in brand.size,speed and other features.Operating system will be installed on of the hard  drives in array,RAID must be implemented before windows is installed because all data on the drive will be lost when you configure RAID.Read the documentation that comes with motherboard or RAID controller and follow those specific directions rather than the general guidelines given.Make sure you understand which RAID configurations the board or card supports.For motherboard that has six SATA connectors that support RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10 here are some directions to install three matching hard drives in a RAID 5    array:
        <ul>
            1. Install the three SATA drives in three computer case and connect each drive to a SATA connector on  the motherboard.To keep all the drives cool,install them with an empty bay between each drive <br>
            2.Boot the system and go to BIOS/UEFI setup.On advanced setup screen,verify that the three drives are recognized.Select the option to configure SATA and then  select RAID from the menu<br>
            3. Reboot the system,A message will be displayed on the screen: press CTRL +1 to enter the RAID configuration utility.<br>
            4. Select option to create RAID volume, and enter volume name<br>
            5.Under RAID level,select the level you want,preffebly RAID 5 because the system has three drives<br>
            6. Select the volume for the strip size.(the amount of space devoted to one strip across the striped array.Chices are 32 kb, 64kb or 128 kb) <br>
            7. Enter the size of the volume but you don't have to use all the available space.The space you don't use,can later be used to configure another array<br>
            8. Select create volume to complete the RAID configuration.A message warns that if you proceed,all data on the drives will be lost.Type Y to continue.The array is created and the system reboots

                <li>To replace hard drive in an enclosure,read a documentation to find out how to open the enclosure</li>
                <li>If a computer overheats,one way to solve this is to remove hard drives and install them in an enclosure but leave hard drive that contains OS</li>
                <li>You can purchase controller card that provides external eSATA connectors to be used when the motherboard eSATA port is not working or when the motherboard does not support a fast SATA standard that your hard drive use.</li>

                    Internal optical drive is usually installed in the drive bay at the top of the desktop case,it is connected  to the motherboard by power cable and data cable.Windows first starts up after the drive is installed, it recognizes the drive and installs drives.Use device manager to verify that the drive installed with no errors and is ready to use. <br>External optical drive can also be connected using USB port in cases where internal is not working or there is no connectors or anything else.The external optical drive is mostly used in new laptops,like netbook which has no internal optical drive

                <h6>Replacing an optical drive on a laptop</h6>
             <p>
                 The newer laptops have taken a trend of not installing optical drive as a strategy to save size and weight of the laptop,that's where an external optical drive comes to play whenever there is a need,if the internal optical drive dies,it is lot easy to replace it with external drive that connects in USB port and it is lot cheaper.if you need to remove the internal optical drive,you will need to remove the keyboard to expose the optical drive.<br><b>Follow these steps to remove the DVD drive from laptop system</b> 
                 <ul>
                     <li>
                         <em>Very important</em> Shut down the system unplug the AC adapter, remove the battery and <a href="#">ground yourself</a>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         Remove the screw at the bottom of the case and turn it over to remove the keyboard.You can then move the keyboard to one side,leave the ribbon cable from the motherboard to the keyboard connected.Drive will be exposed
                     </li>
                     <li>Remove the screws that hold the DVD drive to the laptop</li>
                     <li>
                         Slide the drive out of the bay,When you slide the new drive in to the bay,make sure you push it far enough into the bay so that it solidly connects  with the drive connector at the back of the bay.Replace the screw
                     </li>
                </ul>
            In some systems,a the optical drive can be removed by first removing a cover from the bottom of the laptop.Then remove one screw that secures the drive,next push the optical drive out of the case

            <h4>Troubleshooting hard drives</h4>   
                <h6>Slow performance</h6>
                <p>
                    The most common problem about a computer,is running slow.The performance of a computer depends on the perfomance of the processor, motherboard, memory and hard drive.Hard drive type  can affect the speed,full hard drive can also affect performance.For best performance, don't allow your hard  drive to be 70% capacity for SSD and for magnetic drive 80% cacity.
                </p>
                <h6>Windows automatically optimises a drive</h6>
                <p>Why performance might go slow down for magnetic drives and SSD</p>
                <ul>
                    <em>Magnetic drives.</em> When the hard drive is still new, files are written in contigious sectors ( writing without a break).As the drive gets older,files are stored in disconnected fragments on the drive and slow performance can result.To improve performance,every week windows automatically defragments a magnetic drive,rearrenging fragments or parts of files in  contigeous clusters <br>
                    <em>SSD.</em>data is organised in blocks and each block contains many pages.A file can spread severla pages in various blocks.Each time a new page is written to the drive,the entire block to which it belongs to must be read into a buffer, erased and then rewritten with a new page included.When a file is deleted,infornation about the file is deleted but the actual data is not deleted,for this reason,performance can slow down.To improve performance, windows sends the trim command to an SSD to erase a block that no longer contain useful data so that a write operation does not have to manage the data.Once a week,windows sends retrim command to the SSD to erase all blocks that are filled with unsed data.You can use windows defrag and optimization tool (dfrgu.exe)  to verify that windows is defragmenting a magnetic drive and trimming an SSD.When you run <b>dfrgui command in windows.the optimize drive windows appears and reports status of each drive installed in the system
                    </b>
                </ul>
                <h6>Drive manufacturer utilities</h6>
                <p>Most magnetic drive and SSD manufacturers offer free utility you can download and use to update drive firmware and optimise and troubleshoot a drive.<ul>Intel offers SSD toolbox for it's SSD</ul><ul>Seagate has SEaTools for it's magnetic drives and SSD </ul><ul>Kingston offers SSD toolbox for it's drives.</ul></p>

                <h6>Hard drive problems during the boot</h6>
                <p >
                    Hardware problems usually show up at POST,unless there is physical damage to an area of the hard drive that is not accessed during POST.Hard ware problem often make the hard drive inaccessible.If BIOS/UEFI cannot find the hard Drve at POST,it displays an error message similar to one of the following</p>
                <ul style="color: grey;">
                    <li>No boot device available</li>
                    <li>Hard drive not found</li>
                    <li>OS not found</li>
                    <li>Read/write failure</li>
                    <li>Fixed disk error</li>
                    <li>Invalid boot disk</li>
                    <li>Inaccessible boot device</li>
                    <li>RAID not found</li>
                    <li>Drive not recognised</li>
                    <li>RAID stops working</li>
                    <li>Numeric error codes in the 1700s or 10400s</li>
                    <li>S.M.A.R.T. errors during the boot</li>
            </ul>
                    
            <p>
                If BIOS/UEFI can't access the drive,it might be because of the drive,data cable,electrical system,motherboard or a loose connection.<br>Here is a list of few things to check before opening the case
            </p>
            <li>
                <ul>If BIOS/UEFI displays numeric error codes or cryptic messages during POST,check manufacturer for explanations of these codes and messages</ul>
                <ul>Check BIOS/UEFI for any hard drive configurations,set the configurations to default, autodetection is on and reboot the ssystem</ul>
                <ul>Try booting from other  media and diagnostic software</ul>
                <ul>
                    Use  firmware utility to check the status of each disk in the array and check for errors.Access the RAID BIOS/UEFI utility.It will list each disk in array and it's status.If one disk is bad,it might take around two days for large capacity drives for array to rebuild using data on the other disk,in this situation,the status array will show <b>Caution)</b>.If the hard drive has failed,you will need to replace the bad hard drive as soon as the other drive is back.Then you will need to add the drive back to the RAID.This process is called rebuilding a RAID volume.
                </ul>
                <p>If the problem is still not solved,open the case and check the following things.Remember to prepare and ground yourself</p>
                <ul>1. Remove  and reattach all drive cables</ul>
                <ul>2. Remove the RAID or SATA controller card and reseat it or place it in a different slot</ul>
                <ul>3. Inspect the drive for any physical damage</ul>
                <ul>4. Listen to the magnetic drive if it is spinning or lightly touch the metal drive</ul>
                <ul>5. Check the cables for frayed edges or other damage</ul>
                <ul>6. Check installation manual and follow instructions to the par</ul>
                <ul>7. If you receive report of <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('We test our project three times before submition');" >S.M.A.R.T.</a> errors, back up data and replace the drive </ul>
                <ul>
                    8. If windows installation hang or BSOD or never ending,,windows pinwheel or wait icon,,check the hard drive for errors<br><em>a. Use windows startup repair</em><br>
                    <em>b. use the chkdsk command ( chkdsk C: /r )</em>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    9. Windows will separate the drive into one or more partition using the older MBR(Master Boot Record) or the newer GPT (Global Partition Table) partitioning system.This process will take place just before it can format and install a file system
                    <em>a. Repair the BCD (Boot Configuration Data) is a small database that holds parameters.Use bootrec command to rebuild the BCD: <b>bootrec /RebuildBCD</b></em><br>
                    <em>b. Repair the boot sector. To repair a corrupted boot sector,use this command: <b>bootrec /FixBoot</b></em><br>
                    <em>c. Repair the MBR.the bootrec can be used to fix the problem with the MBR.Use this command: <b>bootrec /FixBMR</b></em>
